# pytorch-rgn

This is an unofficial implementation of the Recurrent Geometric Network as described in the paper 
<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/02/14/265231.full.pdf">End-to-End Differentiable Learning of Protein Structure.</a> It is still a work in progress. I haven't tested the model on the <a href="https://github.com/aqlaboratory/proteinnet">ProteinNet</a> dataset that the paper uses, so I cannot confirm that the model successfully reproduces the reported results.

At the current stage this repository is primarily useful as a guide. It does contain a correct, working model in the rgn2 notebook. In the next few weeks, I expect to reproduce the results of the paper, cleanup my code, and generally just make this repository more useful. Stay tuned!
